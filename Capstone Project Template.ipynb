    "__Supporting officials' decision-making to provide better visitors experience in the US__\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this data engineering capstone project is to give students a chance to combine what they've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of learners portfolio that will help to achieve data engineering-related career goals. We could choose to complete the project provided by the Udacity team or define the scope and data ourselves. I took the first approach in building the DW on the data on immigration to the United States provided by Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Scenario\n",
    "We are D2I (Data to Insights), a business consulting firm specialized in data warehouse services through assisting the enterprises with navigating their data needs and creating strategic operational solutions that deliver tangible business results. Specifically, we can help with the modernization of corporations' data warehousing infrastructure by improving performance and ease of use for end users, enhancing functionality, decreasing total cost of ownership while making it possible for real-time decision making. In total, our full suite of services includes helping enterprises with data profiling, data standardization, data acquisition, data transformation and integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been contracted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help them see what is hidden behind the data flood. We aim to model and create a brand new analytics solution on top of the state-of-the-art technolgies available to enable them to unleash insights from data then providing better customer experiences when coming to the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Project\n",
    "Following the Udacity guide for this project, we structured this documentation with steps below:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"

    "_Explain what you plan to do in the project in more detail. What data do you use? What is your end solution look like? What tools did you use? etc_\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scope \n",
    "The main deliverable of our work here will be a data warehouse in the cloud that will support answering questions through analytics tables and dashboards. Additionally, as we developed a general source-of-truth database, the Government of the US could open the solution through a web API so backend web services could query the warehouse for information relating to international visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "For this work we have used the immigration, the global temperature and demographics datasets as well as the descriptions contained in the `I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Architecture\n",
    "The whole solution is cloud based on top of __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__. First, all the datasets were preprocessed with __Apache Spark__ and stored in a staging area in __AWS S3__ bucket. Then, we loaded those to a __Amazon Redshift__ cluster using an __Apache Airflow__ pipeline that transfer and check the quality of the data to finally provide our customers a data mart for their convenient analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](images/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main information and questions a user may want to extract from the data mart would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visitors by nationality.\n",
    "* Visitors by origin.\n",
    "* Visitors by airline.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and the source country.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and source climates.\n",
    "* Correlations between immigration by source region, and the source region temperature.\n",
    "* Correlations between visitor demographics, and states visited.\n",

    "__Immigration Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main dataset and there is a file for each month of the year of 2016 available in the directory `../../data/18-83510-I94-Data-2016/` in the [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) binary database storage format `sas7bdat`. Combined, the 12 datasets have got more than 40 million rows (40.790.529) and 28 columns. For most of the work we used only the month of April of 2016 which has more than three million records (3.096.313)."

Then, we grouped the resulting rows by `State` applying the `sum` function in the numeric columns to make a cosolidated total in each U.S State. We needed to transform the column `Race` in order to make its different values to become different columns. We achieve this by usig the pivot function of the `pyspark` package.

    "#### Step 5: Complete Project Write Up\n",
    "__Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole solution implemented here is mounted on top of cloud computing technology, AWS in particular. Because the cloud computing provides a low-cost, scalable, and highly reliable infrastructure platform in the cloud this is a natural choice for every new solution like we did here. Every service we use (S3, EMR, Redshift) has reasonable cost and is ‘pay as you go’ pricing. So we can start small and scale as our solution grows. No up-front costs involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, why we use the following services:\n",
    "\n",
    "__S3:__ Provides a relatively cheap, easy-to-use with scalability, high availability, security, and performance. This seems to be perfect to a staging area like our solution here;\n",
    "\n",
    "__Spark:__ This is simply the best framework for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Most of our team are pythonians and Spark has a very convenient API for python programmers to use;\n",
    "\n",
    "__EMR:__ This is a cloud-native big data platform, allowing teams to process vast amounts of data quickly, and cost-effectively at scale using Spark. EMR is easy to use, secure, elastic and low-cost. Perfect to our project;\n",
    "\n",
    "__Redshift:__ A natural and logical choice since we based all the solution in the cloud in AWS. Redshift provides a massively parallel, column-oriented data warehouse that provides easy-scale functionality. The main analytical tools have native interface to load from Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Propose how often the data should be updated and why__\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we receive one file per month it seems reasonable to update the model monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Write a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:__\n",
    "\n",
    " * The data was increased by 100x:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling the whole pipeline should not be a problem at all. Since the whole solution is on top of Amazon cloud, that are easily scalable, the only thing we would need to do is increase the number of nodes of the clusters in EMR to hadle more data. Also, Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse that can expand to exabyte-scale;\n",
    " \n",
    "* The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The runnig interval of the Airflow DAG could be changed to daily and scheduled to run overnight to make the data available y 7am.\n",
    " \n",
    "* The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.\n",
    " \n",
    "Again, not a big problem. With Redshift we can make use of the feature \"elastic resize\" that enables us to add or remove nodes in an Amazon Redshift cluster in minutes. This further increases the agility to get better performance and more storage for demanding workloads, and to reduce cost during periods of low demand."
